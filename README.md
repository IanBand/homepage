## What's this?
Something interesting to fill my domain [ian.band](http://ian.band)

## Future
I am currently consider porting this to [irrlicht](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/) or the [ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/) engine.

3d engine criteria:
 - what are the docs like? how easy is it to search? One thing I like about Three js is it just links to wikipedia when it uses technical terms & concepts
 - do the doc pages have code examples?
 - what do the example projects source look like?
 - is it a game engine or a scene graph + rendering pipeline + math tools? I do not want an entire game engine, this is why I am discounting something like Godot or Unity.
 - are the docs searchable on google? (this is a nice bonus but if searching through the site is okay then I'll be happy)
