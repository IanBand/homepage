## What's this?
This is just meant to be something interesting to put on my domain [ian.band](http://ian.band) as a homepage. Inspired by [bruno-simon.com](https://bruno-simon.com/)

## Future
Not sure where this will end up, just a fun side project for now. If it gets significantly bigger I'd probably port it to [irrlicht](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/) or the [ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/) engine.

Working with Three JS has been a dream, It's made me realize I really like making my own game & physics engines, but not my own rendering engines, scene graphs, and vector math libraries. I feel right at home at this level of abstraction. 

My 3d engine criteria:
 - Is it a game engine, or a scene graph + rendering pipeline + math tools? I do not want an entire game engine, this is why I am discounting something like Godot or Unity.
 - What are the docs like? how easy is it to search? One thing I like about Three js is it just links to wikipedia when it uses technical terms & concepts
 - Do the doc pages have code examples?
 - What do the example projects source look like?
 - Are the docs searchable on google? (this is a nice bonus but if searching through the site is okay then I'll be happy)
